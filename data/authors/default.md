Hi ðŸ‘‹ , my name is Umer Farooq.

I used to enjoy doing software engineering at <a href="https://www.freelancer.com">Freelancer.com</a>. These days I am passionate about doing product management at <a href="https://www.spacehip.com.au">Spaceship</a> ðŸš€.

As side ventures, I created two enterprises in the last year. One example was <a href="https://www.helpsavelocals.com">HelpSaveLocals.com</a> which was a marketplace where shoppers could buy discounts and vouchers to aid local businesses harmed by the pandemic. The other website was <a href="https://carsnflights.com/">CarsnFlights.com</a> which is a car rental service.

I'm always happy to talk and connect, you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/umerf1">Linkedin</a>.
