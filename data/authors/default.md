Hi ðŸ‘‹ , my name is Umer Farooq.

I used to enjoy doing software engineering at <a href="https://www.freelancer.com">Freelancer.com</a>, before moving into doing product management at <a href="https://www.spacehip.com.au">Spaceship</a> ðŸš€. After brief stints at [Antler](https://www.antler.co/) and [Different](https://different.com.au/), currently I am building [Ceri](https://ceri.app?utm=umer).

As side ventures, I created two enterprises in the last year. One was <a href="https://www.helpsavelocals.com">HelpSaveLocals.com</a> which was a marketplace where shoppers could buy discounts and vouchers to aid local businesses harmed by the pandemic. The other website was <a href="https://carsnflights.com/">CarsnFlights.com</a> which is a car rental service.

I'm always happy to talk and connect, you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/umerf1">Linkedin</a>.
