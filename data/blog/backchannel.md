summary: Powering e-commerce in the metaverse
---

As part of the Antler's AU Winter Cohort 2021, I participated in an unsuccessful pitch to VCs for some money. The area of focus was on how we need an API layer to support creators in helping them monetize e-commerce in the metaverse. We called it Backchannel.

Below is the slide deck:

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Canvabackchannel/>
  </div>
</div>
