I highly recommend Tony Fadell's book [Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Unorthodox-Guide-Making-Things/dp/0063046067). It is one of the best non-fiction books I have read in 2022. It offers no bullshit, practical advice on how to build products, make decisions, and navigate your career in tech. Below are top takeaways from the wonderful book.

You can also skip to the bullet point [TLDR](#TLDR) section at the bottom.

### Mission driven assholes are the best:

- dont become a management consultant.
- manager bit and micromanagement. honesty better than style.
- data versus opinion and what you need to do.
- assholes can be good also.
- product lessons
- get better at story telling
- evoltion bit and how team for v1 is different than v2. write a press release for v1
- remember about 35
