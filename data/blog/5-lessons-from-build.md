I highly recommend Tony Fadell's book [Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Unorthodox-Guide-Making-Things/dp/0063046067). It is one of the best non-fiction books I have read in 2022. It offers no bullshit, practical advice on how to build products, make decisions, and navigate your career in tech. Below are top takeaways from the wonderful book.

You can also skip to the bullet point [TLDR](#TLDR) section at the bottom.

## Recognise the asshole

During your professional journey, you may encounter individuals who are difficult to work with. It is important for you to identify the type of person you are dealing with to navigate the situation. There are the types of assholes that you may encounter:

### Political assholes

People who are concerned with advancing their own political agendas, rather than the success of the project or team, can be referred to as "political assholes." These individuals may focus on appearances and be hesitant to take risks. It is important not to get too caught up in their behaviour, as eventually they will be held accountable for their actions. **Based on my experience in startups, I have noticed that these types of individuals are often hired as executives during the scaling phase, and tend to come from larger corporations.** These are the individuals who care more about themselves rather than the product.

### Mission-driven assholes

These are the people who are devoted to the success of the product and are willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen. Even if it means pushing the team to their limits or being direct in their feedback. These are the individuals that you should aim to work with or work for. As they are driven by a strong sense of purpose and are open to hearing different perspectives. In my experience, founders often fall into this category. If the startup you are a part of is successful, it is likely due to the efforts of a mission-driven asshole. **I am not implying that being an asshole is a necessary requirement for success, as exemplified by Steve Jobs.**

## Data vs opinion

### v1 vs v2

- manager bit and micromanagement. honesty better than style.
- evoltion bit and how team for v1 is different than v2. write a press release for v1
- data versus opinion and what you need to do.
- product lessons - add one liners
- add about marketing.
- get better at story telling
- remember about 35

## <a name="TLDR"></a> TLDR - Summary

- Mission driven assholes can be the best of assholes to work with.
