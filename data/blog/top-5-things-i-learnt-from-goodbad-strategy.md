To my surprise, I enjoyed reading [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com.au/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239). I learned a great deal from this book, and I recommend that everyone read it.

Below are my top 5 learnings from the masterpiece.

If short on time you can also skip to the bullet point [TLDR](#TLDR) section at the bottom.

## 1) Strategy is NOT X.

The world the filled with either bad strategy or imitations of it. As for most things in life, it is easier to identify a terrible version than it is to recognise a good one.

#### - Strategy is not a goal.

When I reflect on my ten-year work experience at start-ups, this lesson hits home. It's astonishing how many times I've seen strategy exposed as a target to hit. I've seen this mistake made by recent grads to industry veterans. Come to think of it, why wouldn't a start-up want to grow its MAUs, DAUs, $$$, AUM, FUM etc. **Strategy is the madness behind the destination not the destination itself.**

#### - Strategy should not come from a template NOR it is a checklist of things to do.

Have you noticed how many strategy presentations look like they come from [here](https://www.canva.com/templates/?query=strategy&filters=eyJBPyI6IkIiLCJBIjoiTUBFak1kTTV4N01FazAxdyJ9) ?

#### - Best way to smell bad strategy is look for fluff words.

### 7) underperformance shouldnt be stated as a challenge.

### 2) It's easier to describe competitor strategy rather than yours

### 8) the rise of template style strategy. origins of new thought

### 16) strategy is not a crank winding exercise like product DVF, etc

### 3) Strategy is mostly about saying no.

    - try to avoid dog's dinner.

### 4) Walmart was the OG tech company before Amazon.

### 6) A good strategy always identifies the challenges.

### 9) focus on diagnosis

### 10) Wells Fargo Robinhood, SoFi, etc etc

### 11) more dynamic the situation the more simple objective needs to be.

### 12) internet blurs the line between communications, data and entertainment.

### 13) auto pilot feature.

### 14) culture can only be changed from the top.

### 15) nvidia beat intel on release cycle speed.

### 17) make a list

### TLDR

- Figure out your differentiating leverage.
- OKR is a strategy-alignment exercise, not a strategy-creation activity.
- Bad strategy can be detected if it is riddled with fluff words or disguised as a goal.
- Focus on the diagnosis of the situation.
- Strategy is the [How](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1460848932116844550?s=20).
