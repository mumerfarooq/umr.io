It’s tempting to frame Robotaxi vs. Waymo as LiDAR vs. vision-only. The tech debate is fun, but it’s a sideshow.

The real question is: which business model wins? This is about how costs, incentives, and distribution are organized. This is also where Uber’s role gets interesting.

I was struck when I learned [Waymo had partnered with Uber](https://waymo.com/blog/2024/09/waymo-and-uber-expand-partnership), letting riders book a Waymo directly in the Uber app. At first, it felt counterintuitive. Why wouldn’t Alphabet want to own the customer relationship? Waymo already has an app out. Aren’t autonomous vehicles supposed to be cheaper than human-driven cars? [These cars are already the hottest tourist attactions in SF!](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1cy4cs2/san_franciscos_hot_tourist_attraction_driverless/)

### Shouldn't Waymo just get more cars on the road and give Uber and Tesla a run for their money?

To understand why that might not be easy, we need to look at Uber’s business model. Specially, what are the actual costs for the driver. The simplest way to look at it per ride.

**Leftover for the human** = What the rider pays – Uber’s cut – car costs.

**Car costs** = Depreciation (10–15%) + Loan interest (2–5%) + Fuel(5–10%) + Insurance(3–6%) + Maintenance(2–5%)

Once you break down the car costs, it becomes clear: Uber’s business model has low [capital intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_intensity). It has built a massive network of cars without owning them. The model is similar to Airbnb, where landlords provide the capital and often finance it through banks. Only difference being that here the underlying asset (vehicle) depreciates.

So now the question is who wants to provide capital for all the Waymos? As they could cost upto [200k](https://bonjour.uber.com/marketplace/marketplaces/vehicles_us/fixed_earnings_category). other than cars you need fleet services. infrastrucutre.

- does alphabet wants to burn cash?
- Waymo has a decision to make? be a consumer brand? be a tech company where one could license the technology and rely on uber's fleet services?
- should we be long on hertz and car rentals companies?
- tesla already has cars on the road.
- how will the world change?
- is it a better product? then humans?
