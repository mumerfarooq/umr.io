The world the filled with either bad strategy or imitations of it. As for most things in life, it is easier to identify a terrible version than it is to recognize a good one.

To my surprise, I enjoyed reading [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com.au/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239). Below are my top learnings from the masterpiece. You can also skip to the bullet point [TLDR](#TLDR) section at the bottom.

### Strategy is not your goals.

When I reflect on my ten-year work experience at start-ups, this lesson hits home. It's astonishing how many times I've seen strategy exposed as a target to hit. I've seen this mistake made by recent graduates to industry veterans. Come to think of it, why wouldn't a company want to grow its MAUs, DAUs, $$$, AUM, FUM etc. **Strategy is the madness towards the destination not the destination itself.**

### Strategy is not a checklist of things to do.

Echoing the sentiment above, put your âœ‹ up if someone has pointed you to an OKR excel sheet or product road map when you enquired about strategy.

### Strategy should not come from a template.

Have you noticed how many strategy presentations look like cookie-cutter consultant [work](https://www.canva.com/templates/EADaood59tE-orange-corporate-strategy-map-chart/)? If you see a template simlar to this that means the CEO was too lazy and hired consultants. I totally agree with Toby [here](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1266801564855021568).

### Strategy is not a vision statement.

A vision statement is another thing which is thrown around when we talk about strategy but one needs to realise that strategy is not the destination. For example, if you read WellsFargo's mission statement they both

> Our vision is to satisfy our customers' financial needs and help them succeed financially

and then Robinhood's S1

> As our customers grow their wealth, we believe they will continue to expand their relationship with our platform, providing an increased opportunity to meet their growing financial needs.

They both have almost the same vision. WellsFargo is a bank and wants to remain relevant and Robinhood wants to be bank where the distribution channel of their products is their mobile app.

### Best way to smell bad strategy is look for fluff words.

### 7) underperformance shouldnt be stated as a challenge.

### 2) It's easier to describe competitor strategy rather than yours

### 16) strategy is not a crank winding exercise like product DVF, etc

### 3) Strategy is mostly about saying no.

    - try to avoid dog's dinner.

### 6) A good strategy always identifies the challenges.

### 9) focus on diagnosis

### 11) more dynamic the situation the more simple objective needs to be.

To my surprise, I enjoyed reading [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com.au/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239).

Below are my top learnings from the masterpiece.

### TLDR

- Figure out your differentiating leverage. Things which you are good at and double down.
- Focus on the diagnosis of the situation aka identify your challenges.
- OKR is an strategy-alignment exercise, not a strategy-creation activity.
- Strategy is the [How](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1460848932116844550?s=20) **NOT** the What.
- More dynamic the situation the more simple objective needs to be.
- Strategy is mostly about saying NO.
- Don't know where to start? Start with a list. **FOCUS**.
