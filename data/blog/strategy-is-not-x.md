The world the filled with either bad strategy or imitations of it. As for most things in life, it is easier to identify a terrible version than it is to recognize a good one.

You can also skip to the bullet point [TLDR](#TLDR) section at the bottom.

### Strategy is not your goals.

When I reflect on my ten-year work experience at start-ups, this lesson hits home. It's astonishing how many times I've seen strategy exposed as a target to hit. I've seen this mistake made by recent graduates to industry veterans. Come to think of it, why wouldn't a start-up want to grow its MAUs, DAUs, $$$, AUM, FUM etc. **Strategy is the madness towards the destination not the destination itself.**

### Strategy is not a checklist of things to do.

Echoing the sentiment above, put your âœ‹ up if someone has pointed you to an OKR excel sheet or product road map when you enquired about strategy.

### Strategy should not come from a template.

Have you noticed how many strategy presentations look like cookie-cutter consultant [work](https://www.canva.com/templates/EADaood59tE-orange-corporate-strategy-map-chart/) ? I totally agree with Toby [here](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1266801564855021568).

### Strategy is not a vision statement.

A vision statement is another thing which is thrown around when we talk about strategy.

### 10) Wells Fargo Robinhood, SoFi, etc etc

### Best way to smell bad strategy is look for fluff words.

### 7) underperformance shouldnt be stated as a challenge.

### 2) It's easier to describe competitor strategy rather than yours

### 8) the rise of template style strategy. origins of new thought

### 16) strategy is not a crank winding exercise like product DVF, etc

### 3) Strategy is mostly about saying no.

    - try to avoid dog's dinner.

### 4) Walmart was the OG tech company before Amazon.

### 6) A good strategy always identifies the challenges.

### 9) focus on diagnosis

### 11) more dynamic the situation the more simple objective needs to be.

### 14) culture can only be changed from the top.

### 15) nvidia beat intel on release cycle speed.

To my surprise, I enjoyed reading [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com.au/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239).

Below are my top learnings from the masterpiece.

### TLDR

- Figure out your differentiating leverage. Things which you are good at and double down.
- Identify your challenges.
- OKR is an strategy-alignment exercise, not a strategy-creation activity.
- Bad strategy can be detected if it's riddled with fluff words or disguised as a goal or looks like it came from template.
- Focus on the diagnosis of the situation.
- Strategy is the [How](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1460848932116844550?s=20) **NOT** the What.
- More dynamic the situation the more simple objective needs to be.
- Strategy is mostly about saying NO. Avoid dog's dinner.
- Don't know where to start? Start with a list. **FOCUS**.
